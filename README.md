# Predicting-website-clicks
This project predicts website clicks using time series data with two models: additive seasonal effect and moving average. The best model is selected based on performance metrics. Forecasting traffic helps owners allocate resources and identify seasonal patterns for marketing.

The objective of this project is to use time series data of a website to predict the number of clicks on the website. The data consists of the number of clicks on the website over a period of time, with time intervals of fixed duration. The data may have seasonal patterns, which are trends that repeat over a fixed interval of time, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

To perform the prediction, two models are used: additive seasonal effect model and moving average model. The additive seasonal effect model decomposes the time series into seasonal, trend, and random components, and models each component separately. The seasonal component captures the repeating patterns in the data, the trend component captures the overall direction of the data, and the random component captures the unpredictable fluctuations in the data. The model then combines these components to make predictions.

The moving average model, on the other hand, uses a sliding window of fixed size to smooth out the fluctuations in the data and make predictions based on the average value of the data within the window.

Both models are implemented using statistical software such as R or Python, and the performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The models are then compared, and the one with better performance is selected for the final prediction of the number of clicks on the website.

This project can be useful for website owners to forecast the traffic on their website and plan for server capacity and resource allocation. It can also help in identifying the seasonal patterns of user behavior on the website, which can be used for targeted marketing and advertising campaigns.
